## GET VERSION
[Source File: getVersion.c](https://github.com/archethic-foundation/archethic-ledger/blob/master/src/getVersion.c)
:::info
Get version returns the version of Device Application on Ledger
:::
- Function Signature
     **handleGetVersion(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t \*dataBuffer, uint16_t dataLength, volatile unsigned int \*flags)**
     - **p1** -> APDU Parameter (Not Concerned in our context)
     - **p2** ->  APDU Parameter (Not Concerned in our context)
     - **\*dataBuffer** -> NULL (Not required for getting version)
     - **dataLength** -> Length of the dataBuffer
     - **\*flags** -> **Modes (respond immediately(sync), process and respond(async))**

    There is a general buffer **G_io_apdu_buffer** (already in ledger SDK) for both input and output, we copy version to this buffer from **APPVERSION** which is defined in Makefile. As we only need integer, so we subtract '0' from the APPVERSION[0 | 2 | 4].
    APPVERSION and APPNAME are defined in the makefile of the project.
    
    **io_exchange_with_code(SW_OK, 3)**
        - It adds status at the end of the Buffer (G_io_apdu_buffer).
        - **SW_OK** (0x9000) adds status code at the end of the buffer.
        - 3 is the length of the data in the buffer. 
     

## GET DEVICE ORIGIN PUBLIC KEY
[Source File: getPublicKey.c](https://github.com/archethic-foundation/archethic-ledger/blob/master/src/getPublicKey.c)

:::info
Gets the hardware(device origin) public key from ledger device.

:::
    
It returns the public key derived from the hardware ledger device seed (**HARDWARE SEED**).

- Function Signature
    **handleGetPublicKey(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t \*dataBuffer, uint16_t dataLength, volatile unsigned int \*flags)**
    - **\*flags |= IO_ASYNCH_REPLY;** 
        This is added to get response from the user of HID. So needed to be set to the ASYNC.
    - **getOriginPublicKey(cx_ecfp_public_key_t \*publicKey)**
    This calls <strong>deriveArchethicKeyPair</strong> and return it.
    ``` deriveArchEthicKeyPair(CX_CURVE_SECP256K1, 650, 0xffff, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, publicKey); ```

::: info
:notebook: Notes
    * **First Param** is the curve type which is fixed in our case.
    * **Second Param** is the coin type which is defined for the [UCO Token]()
    * **3rd Param** is for the account which account to get,  which is defined as: 
         $account =$ Depends on the intended use of the key.
         Currently fixed values: 0xFFFF for $o_{key}$, 0x0000 for a simple $w_{key}$
    * **4th Param** is address index 
    * **5th Param** is masterSeed which is set to NULL because we need the device origin master seed.
    * **6th Param** is the master seed Length
    * **7th param** is the structure to store public key
:::
    
- Function Signature
    **deriveArchEthicKeyPair(cx_curve_t curve, uint32_t coin_type, uint32_t account, uint32_t address_index, uint8_t \*masterSeed, uint8_t masterSeedLen, cx_ecfp_private_key_t \*privateKey, cx_ecfp_public_key_t \*publicKey)**
    - This function first checks the curve type of the `cx_curve_t`, which sets the mode for the which it needs to perform operation.
    - Next depending upon the account type as defined in the specification (0xffff | 0x0000) it derives the private key from the masterseed.
        - When the account type is `0xffff` then **os_perso_derive_node_with_seed()** function is called which derives the key from the ledger hardware origin key.
        - When account type is `0x0000` then it derives the rawPrivateKey from the from **archethic_derive_with_seed_key()** function which derives the key as per provided params.

    -  Next it checks if there is a **publicKey**
        -  If that is the case then it derives the corresponding public key and generates from the walletPrivateKey
    -  If there is **privateKey** the it simple returns the **privateKey**.

As Public Key is in format: **[curve_type, device_origin, 04xy]**

02 -> Curve Type 04 -> Device Origin 04 -> uncompressed 

X -> 52e77c79bea0f84e2d9c40356932fb0dd31688c23d6b6e9ac99d2869dc407692

Y -> 1e731fb84d0a094c6273fffed68147c381a273c83868cdeb9b81c7ec790c6d38

:::

::: info

Since raw private key is in **bytes** it needs to be converted which is done by the function cx_ecfp_init_private_key(curve, rawPrivateKey, 32, &walletPrivateKey).

## GET ARCHETHIC ADDRESS

[Source File: getAddress.c](https://github.com/archethic-foundation/archethic-ledger/blob/master/src/getAddress.c)

- Function Signature
    **handleGetAddress(uint8_t p1, uint8_t p2, uint8_t \*dataBuffer, uint16_t dataLength, volatile unsigned int \*flags)**
    + First 4 bytes are address index hence we store then in `address_index` from the data buffer (Converting them according to thier byte ordering.)
    + We performECDH to get the secret pointX on the curve,
        + Fn Signature **performECDH(uint8_t \*ephPublicKey, uint8_t ephPublicKeySize, uint8_t \*ecdhPointX)**
        + This derives an archethic keypair first with function `deriveArchEthicKeyPair` and gets originPrivateKey

        + `cx_ecdh(&originPrivateKey, CX_ECDH_X, ephPublicKey, ephPublicKeySize, ecdhPointX, 32);`
        + publicKey is taken from the `dataBuffer`
    + Now we decrypt the wallet with the ecdhPointX 
        + Fn Signature **decryptWallet(ecdhPointX, sizeof(ecdhPointX), dataBuffer, dataLength, g_wallet.encodedWallet, &g_wallet.walletLen);**
        + Since we have moved pointer we now only have `auth_tag` 16 bytes and enc($wk_{aes}$) 32bytes
            + Inside Decrypt wallet we first calculate the `aes_key_iv_tag` from the ecdhPointX by double hashing it from the sha512 function $sha512(sha512(ecdh\_secret\ or\ PointX))$. 
            + we get 3 parts from above double hashing in 64 bytes which are

            + Now we get sha256 has of auth_seed in `auth_key`
            + And now we do hmac(auth_key , enc($wk_{aes}$)) and get `auth_tag` which are first 16 bytes from hmac result. $Rest\ 16\ bytes\ are\ reserved$
            + Now we compare if auth_tag equals to auth_tag supplied in the `dataBuffer` 
                + If if doesn't return `0xBADDECODE`
                + If it does
                    + Decrypt the wallet and return the **encoded wallet**
        + Now get the BIP44Paths from the encoded wallet according to specificaton
            + Fn Signature **getBIP44Path(address_index, g_wallet.encodedWallet, g_wallet.walletLen, 0, g_bip44_path, &bip44pathlen);**
            + This does according to address index which were first 4 bytes of `dataBuffer`
            + This returns the bip44Path in `char* string_bip_44`
        + Now Generate Archethic Address from the Encoded Wallet and set as required. 
            + Fn Signature **generateArchEthicAddress(uint8_t hash_type, uint32_t address_index, uint8_t \*encoded_wallet, uint8_t \*wallet_len, uint32_t sequence_no, uint8_t \*address, uint8_t \*address_len)**
            + For now only support hash_type `sha256`
            + Returns address in `uint8_t *address`
                + It generates key from the encoded wallet and storesit in `cx_ecfp_public_key_t` structure
                + Fn Signature **generateKeyFromWallet(address_index, encoded_wallet, wallet_len, sequence_no, &curve_type, NULL, &publicKey)** 
                    + Derives Archethic Keypair depending on the supplied params:

                        + **account**
                        + **curve**
                        + **address_index**
                        + **publicKey**
