## 12 patents to build a new ecosystem

Archethic is based on more than 4 years of research and 12 international patents.
5 patents aim at removing all logins, passwords and identification cards that pollute and weaken our environment by replacing them with a universal biometric identification, unfalsifiable and guaranteeing the privacy of users.

5 other patents, concern the implementation of a real decentralized network, governed by mathematics, resilient to cyber-attacks and allowing to reduce the consumption of the current Internet.

Finally, two patents aim to allow current applications to migrate or interface effortlessly to this new network. Each application will no longer need to master all the technologies to launch its service (identity management, inventory management, payments, interface with external suppliers, etc.) but will be able to rely on a universal exchange platform capable, through smart-contracts, of instantly matching all offers to each request. 

## Archethic, a Humanitarian and Community Project

Once the risk of a fork is removed, all the patents will be transferred to the heritage of the open source technologies, this heritage should likely be transferred to the OIN (Open Invention Network) or equivalent. The entire source code will be AGPL licensed.

## List of patents

### Blockchain
#### Method of transaction validation relating to Transactions Chains through a decentralized network. 
Transaction validation relating to one or more transactions chains in a unitary and asynchronous way by the elimination of all the limitations of Blockchain technology. The process allows enhanced security and confidentiality, in particular by integrating the constraints in terms of geolocation and number of the messages validation.<br/>

#### Method of securing transactions through knowledge and through cross-capabilities across a decentralized network
Cryptographic process to cross-reference the knowledge and capabilities of the devices so as to prohibit any unauthorized operation, renew and permanently forfeit all cryptographic keys of all devices, remove correlation elements of time, value, and actors involved (privacy wheel), initialize cryptographic keys for a decentralized network without using an external device to the system, minimize the exposure of public keys related to  private keys of the device, to reset a device and revoke a user.<br/>
Ref: [FR3049087 (A1)](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/86/18/ee/c63fde292d1186/FR3049087A1.pdf)

### Biometrics

#### Method of Biometric Authentication without disclosure through a decentralized network
A method of not having to reveal all or part of the biometric measurements of an individual - integrating the compensations of the biometric measurements and lifelong morphological adaptability of an individual - never having to store any biometric data or any biometric measurement or a cryptographic key relating to an individual - making it possible to record several fingers of the same individual without disclosure and allowing operations without a network and without an individual having never used any device before.<br/>
