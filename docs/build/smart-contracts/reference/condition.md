Conditions are blocks whose purpose is to check the validity of a transaction. There are 3 types of `condition` block: `inherit`, `transaction`, and `oracle`. The condition blocks are not code block, they are maps of what we call "boolean expressions". In this map, the keys are the transaction property, and the values are expressions that must return a boolean or a value.  
Condition `inherit` is mandatory in all cases, conditions `transaction` and `oracle` are man if the associated trigger is used.

Pseudo-code:
```elixir
condition <type>: [
    <prop1>: <value>,
    <prop2>: <boolean>,
    <prop3>: <expr that returns a value>,
    <prop4>: <expr that returns a boolean>
]
```
- `type` is either `inherit`, `transaction` or `oracle`.
- `prop` is a property of the transaction or `origin_family`. See [Action's Appendix 1](/build/smart-contracts/reference/actions#appendix-1-the-transaction-map) for the available properties.
- `expr` is a code expression.

Example:
```elixir
condition inherit: [
    # <value>
    type: "contract",

    # <boolean>
    content: true,

    # <expr that returns a value>
    code: 
        if Time.now() > 1677572714 do 
            "condition inherit: []"
        else
            previous.code
        end,

    # <expr that returns a boolean>
    uco_transfers: Map.size() > 0
]
```

## Rules

1. **All "boolean expressions" must pass for the transaction to be valid.**
1. If the expression return true, this "boolean expression" passes.
1. If the expression return false, this "boolean expression" fails.
1. If the expression return a value, this "boolean expression" passes if the transaction's property has the same value.

:::info
In these blocks, there is also some sugar to automatically add the property as an argument of the functions called. For example `uco_transfers: Map.size() > 0` will automatically expand to `uco_transfers: Map.size(transaction.uco_transfers) > 0`.
:::

## Condition inherit

The `condition inherit` purpose is to check the next transaction generated by the smart contract after its code execution. It ensure the next transaction respect specific rules so the smart contract chain cannot be compromised.

```elixir 
condition inherit: [...]
```

:::tip
If the map is empty `[]`, it means the transaction chain is closed: no transaction will be accepted anymore.
:::

There are 2 global variables for this condition block:
1. `previous` is the transaction of the current contract.
1. `next` is the "next transaction".

See [Action's Appendix 1](/build/smart-contracts/reference/actions#appendix-1-the-transaction-map) for the details of the transaction map.

:::caution
A specific rule is applied for inherit condition, if a field is not specified in the conditions, it assume that it must have the same value as the previous transaction. ie. `code: previous.code == next.code`
:::

### Examples

Pass only if it is executed before a timestamp:
```elixir 
condition inherit: [
    timestamp: next.timestamp < 1677598185
]
```

Pass only if the transaction is type "transfer", without any uco_transfers and at least one token_transfers:
```elixir
condition inherit: [
    type: "transfer",
    uco_transfers: Map.size() == 0,
    token_transfers: Map.size() > 0
]
```

Pass only if chain has been closed (the code part) and there is a UCO transfer to an address depending on the time:
```elixir 
condition inherit: [
    code: "condition inherit: []",
    uco_transfers: 
        if Time.now() >= 1674564088 do
            ["00003bafdfb7a8e66b59de5692b79088063853bbd69a7d555faec906e6215e57ff98": 2]
        else
            ["0000ba28ce06631ff2ef4fe3dc89a34be13c0d252f8952bbfa3173b03dbef3c04afd": 2]
        end
]
```

Pass only if the key "index" of the content is greater than the previous one:
```elixir
# Note that we have to embed a block code inside parenthesis to create variable
condition inherit: [
    content: (
        json_path = "$.index"
        if Json.path_match?(next.content, json_path) do
            previous_index = Json.path_extract(previous.content, json_path)
            new_index = Json.path_extract(next.content, json_path)

            new_index > previous_index
        else
            false
        end
    )
]
```

## Condition transaction

The `condition transaction` purpose is to check the transaction that triggered the contract (a transaction with the contract address in the recipients).

```elixir
condition transaction: [...]
```

:::tip
If the map is empty `[]`, it means any transaction can trigger the contract.
:::

There are 2 global variables for this condition block:
1. `contract` is the transaction of the current contract.
1. `transaction` is the transaction that triggered the contract.

See [Action's Appendix 1](/build/smart-contracts/reference/actions#appendix-1-the-transaction-map) for the details of the transaction map.

### Examples

Pass only if the transaction that triggered the contract comes from a specific chain (a chain can be identified by it's genesis address):
```elixir 
condition transaction: [
    address: Chain.get_genesis_address() == "00001234ab..."
]
```

Pass only if the transaction that triggered sent 10 UCOs to this contract:
```elixir 
condition transaction: [
    uco_transfers: Map.get(contract.address) == 10
]
```

## Condition oracle

The `condition oracle` purpose is to check the oracle transaction that triggered the contract.

```elixir
condition oracle: [...]
```

:::tip
If the map is empty `[]`, it means any transaction can trigger the contract.
:::

There are 2 global variables for this condition block:
1. `contract` is the transaction of the current contract.
1. `transaction` is the oracle transaction that triggered the contract.

See [Action's Appendix 1](/build/smart-contracts/reference/actions#appendix-1-the-transaction-map) for the details of the transaction map.

### Examples

Pass only if the transaction's content is a JSON string including the UCO price in USD.
```elixir 
condition oracle: [
    content: Json.path_match?(transaction.content, "$.uco.usd")
]
```
