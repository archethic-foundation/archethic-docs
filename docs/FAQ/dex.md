### Why is a small quantity of liquidity pool shares removed when the first liquidity is added to a pool on Archethic?
During the initial creation of liquidity in a pool on Archethic, a small quantity of pool shares (exactly 10 shares on a scale of 100 million per share) is removed to prevent manipulations and rounding issues. This process involves the "burning" (destruction) of these shares by removing them from circulation. When a pool is created, we subtract 10 shares from what would normally be minted (created) for the user. 

This prevents potential attacks where someone might try to manipulate the value of the pool shares with very small amounts of liquidity, thus making participation more secure and equitable for all future liquidity providers. This mechanism ensures that the shares remain accessible even if the value of the pool increases significantly.

## Wallet

### I’m using the Mainnet network in the Wallet, how can I switch on the Testnet?
The switch is not possible because the seed is not shared between Mainnet and Testnet. Later, the wallet will be multiseeds, but not for the moment. The only way for the moment is to remove the Wallet (don’t forget the 24 words) and create/import a wallet on the Testnet network.

### Why can't I connect to the Archethic wallet with my Brave browser?
Brave includes a shield feature that might block certain local connections.
To successfully connect to the Archethic wallet, you'll need to modify the Brave browser’s shield settings as per its documentation
