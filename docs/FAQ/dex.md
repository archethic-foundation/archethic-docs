## Wallet

### I’m using the Mainnet network in the Wallet, how can I switch on the Testnet?
The switch is not possible because the seed is not shared between Mainnet and Testnet. Later, the wallet will be multiseeds, but not for the moment. The only way for the moment is to remove the Wallet (don’t forget the 24 words) and create/import a wallet on the Testnet network.

### Why can't I connect to the Archethic wallet with my Brave browser?
Brave includes a shield feature that might block certain local connections.
To successfully connect to the Archethic wallet, you'll need to modify the Brave browser’s shield settings as per its documentation
