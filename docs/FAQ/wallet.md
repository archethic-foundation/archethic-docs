### ** How to retrieve the address of my Archethic wallet?**

Firstly, you should be aware that your address changes with each transaction.

But don't worry. If you provide an old address to receive funds or tokens, it will still work, and you will receive what you are expecting.

:::success
If you do not have an Archethic wallet or address yet, we invite you to refer to the section<br/><a href="/FAQ/wallet#-how-to-create-a-wallet-on-the-archethic-blockchain">"How to create a wallet on the Archethic blockchain?"</a>
:::

Once your wallet is created,<br/>
1) select the account you wish to receive your funds or tokens on via the "Keychain" tab, which lists your accounts and services contained in your decentralized keychain.<br/>
2) Once selected, the application will display the "Main" tab, where a "Receive" button is shown.<br/>
3) Click on it, and you will get your address, either in the form of a QR Code or in text form by clicking on the icon corresponding to the copy action.<br/>
