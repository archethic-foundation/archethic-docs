title: "Migration of ERC-20 UCO Tokens"
---

## General 

### ** Why Archethic migrates his ERC20 UCO Token? **

#### Project Background:
The Archethic project initially launched a token called UCO (Archethic Universal Coin), based on the ERC-20 standard, available on several blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, and the BNB Chain. Since then, the project has made significant progress, including the launch of its own blockchain (mainnet) in December 2022, and the opening of a bridge and a decentralized exchange in May 2024.

Now that the UCO is natively available on the Archethic blockchain, it is time to update the ERC-20 token to reflect these changes.

#### Why a Migration?
The migration to a new ERC-20 UCO token is necessary for several reasons:

- **Updating Information**: The current ERC-20 token is outdated. For example, the token's name and the total supply need to be modified to reflect the project's current status.

- **Harmonizing Functionality**: The current versions of the UCO token on different blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain) do not function in the same way. The new ERC-20 UCO token will be designed to operate uniformly across all blockchains, with functions such as mint (creation of new tokens) and burn (destruction of tokens), which are missing in some current versions.

#### What Does This Mean for users?
If you hold ERC-20 UCO tokens, you will need to migrate them to the new version (Version 2). This migration ensures that you will be using an up-to-date, secure token that functions across all compatible blockchains.

The migration will be facilitated by a specially designed smart contract to make this process as simple and secure as possible. You will also have access to tools to help you transition smoothly.

#### In Summary:
Migrating to the new ERC-20 UCO token is essential to ensure that users' tokens remain up-to-date with the latest developments in the Archethic project. This update will allow for better compatibility and security while harmonizing the token's functionality across all blockchains.

### How do I migrate my V1 tokens to V2?
To migrate your tokens, simply go to the migration tool at [archethic.net/migrate-uco](https://archethic.net/migrate-uco). This tool allows you to securely migrate your tokens on each blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon).

### If I have 3000 UCO in V1, how many UCO will I receive in V2?
The migration is done at a 1:1 ratio. This means that if you migrate 3000 UCO V1, you will receive 3000 UCO in V2.

### How much does the migration cost the user?
There is no service fee for the migration. However, you will need to pay the transaction fees associated with the blockchains to execute the smart contract. These fees depend on the Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC blockchains.

### I have UCO with more than 8 decimal places; does this have an impact?
The UCO on EVM blockchains (like Ethereum) has 18 decimal places, but on Archethic, it has only 8. During the migration, only the first 8 decimal places will be retained.
For example, if you have 100.123456789123456789 UCO, after migration, you will have 100.12345678 UCO.
