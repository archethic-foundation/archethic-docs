# FAQ: Retrieve and Convert Node Rewards via the Archethic Wallet

This FAQ is designed for **aeBot node owners** to help retrieve and convert their rewards (**MUCO**) into **UCO**. If you have any further questions, contact the Archethic technical team via their official social network channels.

## General Questions

### **What is MUCO?**
MUCO is a fungible token used exclusively for node rewards in the Archethic network.  
- **Conversion Rate:** 1 MUCO = 1 UCO.

### **How do I convert MUCO into UCO?**
To convert MUCO into UCO, you need to **send MUCO to another Archethic address**. The process is automatic, and the equivalent amount in UCO will appear in the destination address.

## Setting Up

### **What do I need before starting?**
1. Install the **aeWallet** application from [here](https://www.archethic.net/wallet.html).
2. Identify your **Reward Address** in the [Archethic Explorer](https://explorer.archethic.net/):  
   - Go to **Nodes** â†’ **List**.
   - Select your node and copy the address listed under **Reward Address**.

### **What if the Reward Address is incorrect?**
If the reward address is not linked to your wallet, contact the Archethic technical team and provide them with your new reward address.

## Technical Details

### **Can I send MUCO to the same address to convert them?**
No, you cannot send MUCO to the same address from which they originated. You must use another address, either:
- Another account in your wallet.
- An address in a different compatible wallet.

### **Do I need UCO to convert MUCO?**
Yes, a small amount of UCO is required to cover transaction fees during the conversion process.

### **What happens if the conversion fails?**
Ensure:
- You used a valid Archethic address (starting with `0000`).
- Your account has enough UCO to pay for transaction fees.
If the issue persists, contact the Archethic technical team for assistance.

## Troubleshooting and Support

### **How do I verify the UCO balance after conversion?**
1. Return to the **Accounts** tab in aeWallet.  
2. Check the destination address to confirm the UCO has been credited. The amount will match the MUCO sent (1 MUCO = 1 UCO).
