## General 

### **What is the purpose of a .gitignore file?**

The .gitignore file serves to exclude specific files and directories from version control with Git. In the context of AEWeb, it's used to prevent the upload and synchronization of configuration and development files that are specific to the Git repository. This ensures that only the essential files of the website are transferred during the upload process.
