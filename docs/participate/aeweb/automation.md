AEWeb's CLI is really simple to deploy websites from the command line and is handy on low-frequent deployment usage.
However, if you need to deploy often a website, the CLI might not be the great tool.

To resolve this issue, we have planed a way to automate the deployment of your websites using Github's Actions.

This is a simple automation that allow you to deploy to Archethic decentralized web hosting. Under the hood, it's running some part of the AEWeb CLI features.

You can decide when your codebase will be deployed on Archethic, for instance foreach push or validated pull-request, or after each release.

[Check our Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/archethic-web) to discover how to use it and leverage continuous deployment on Archethic.
