## Math
The underlying mathematics of aeSwap's AMM involves complex algorithms that balance liquidity provision, pricing, and swap efficiency. These algorithms are designed to minimize slippage, ensure fair asset valuation, and mitigate risks such as impermanent loss. Rigorous testing and auditing of the smart contracts underpinning these mathematical models are essential for platform integrity and user trust.
