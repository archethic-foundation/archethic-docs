# Security, Research & Math

## Research & Math
aeSwap integrates comprehensive research and mathematical algorithms directly inspired by Uniswap V2, covering AMM models, smart contract security, blockchain technology, liquidity provision, pricing, and swap efficiency. This synergy ensures a secure trading environment, minimizes slippage, ensures fair asset valuation, and mitigates risks such as impermanent loss. Continuous analysis of market trends, attack vectors, and user behavior, along with rigorous testing and auditing of smart contracts, forms the backbone of the platformâ€™s development, risk management strategies, and integrity. The adherence to these proven models and methodologies guarantees the highest standards of security and consistency in the platform's operations.

### The Mathematics of AMM and Constant Product Formula

aeSwap, based on the Uniswap v2 model, employs the constant product formula to maintain pool liquidity and determine prices. This formula is represented as `x * y = k`, where:
- `x` and `y` are the quantities of the two tokens in the liquidity pool.
- `k` is a constant value.

The constant product formula ensures that the total value in the pool remains constant after a trade, excluding fees. When a trade is executed, the product of the quantities of the two tokens stays the same, allowing the AMM to provide liquidity at any price level.


:::info Security Practices
aeSwap adopts best practices in smart contract development and security, including regular audits by reputable firms, bug bounty programs, and transparent communication with the community. The security protocols and measures in place are directly taken from the proven and tested frameworks used in Uniswap V2. This adherence to established best practices, combined with user education on secure wallet management and interaction with DeFi platforms, further enhances the ecosystem's security posture, ensuring a safe and reliable environment for all users.
