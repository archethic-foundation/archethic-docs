# Financials: Fees, APY, Understanding Returns

## Fees
aeSwap charges transaction fees for swaps and liquidity provision. These fees compensate liquidity providers for supplying capital and taking on the risk of impermanent loss. Fees are set as a percentage of the trade value and are directly added to the liquidity pool, proportionally benefitting all liquidity providers.

:::info The fees are approximately $0.03. The fees section will be updated soon
:::

## APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
APY represents the rate of return on liquidity provision and farming over a year. It accounts for compounding interest, providing a comprehensive picture of potential earnings from liquidity and farming activities. aeSwap's APY calculation considers the distribution of rewards and the impact of trading fees, offering a dynamic measure of profitability.

## Understanding Returns
Returns from liquidity provision come from trading fees and, potentially, farming rewards. However, liquidity providers should be aware of impermanent loss, a unique risk where the value of deposited assets could diverge from holding them outside the pool. Understanding these elements is crucial for assessing the overall profitability of participating in aeSwap.
