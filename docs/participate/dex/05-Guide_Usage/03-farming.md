### Interacting with Farms: Available Actions

On aeSwap, participants have the flexibility to engage with farms through a variety of actions, each designed to suit different strategies and needs. Here’s a concise overview of the options available:

**Deposit LP Tokens**: Users can stake their liquidity provider (LP) tokens in a farm to earn rewards. This action contributes to the farm's overall health and rewards the user with tokens based on the farm's current APR. Depositing increases the total value locked (TVL) in the farm and entitles the user to a portion of the rewards generated.

**Withdraw LP Tokens**: When participants decide to retrieve their staked LP tokens from a farm, this action enables them to do so. Withdrawing allows users to claim back their tokens along with any rewards earned during the staking period. This action is crucial for managing your investments and realizing potential gains from the accumulation of rewards.

**Claim Rewards**: Specifically for users who want to continue staking their LP tokens but wish to collect earned rewards, this action allows for the claiming of rewards without affecting the staked LP token balance. It is a flexible option for users looking to realize immediate gains while maintaining their position in the farm.
