# Ecosystem Participants

The aeSwap ecosystem, built on the Archethic Public Blockchain, introduces a decentralized finance (DeFi) environment that is supported by three primary types of participants: liquidity providers, traders, and developers. Each group plays a crucial role in the ecosystem's functionality and growth, contributing to a vibrant and dynamic DeFi landscape.

## Liquidity Providers (LPs)

Liquidity providers are pivotal to the aeSwap ecosystem, offering their assets to the pools and in return, they receive LP tokens. These participants can be categorized as:

- **Passive LPs**: Individuals or entities that contribute their tokens to liquidity pools to earn fees from trading activities without active management.
- **Professional LPs**: Those who engage in liquidity provision as their main strategy, often utilizing advanced tools and methodologies to optimize their returns across various DeFi platforms.
- **Token Projects**: Projects that provide liquidity for their own tokens to ensure a stable and liquid market, facilitating easier exchange and integration within the wider DeFi ecosystem.
- **Innovative LPs**: Pioneers exploring new models of liquidity provision, such as incentivized liquidity positions, using liquidity as collateral, among other experimental approaches.

## Traders

Traders interact with aeSwap to exchange tokens, leveraging the liquidity provided by LPs. Traders are essential for maintaining the dynamic pricing mechanism of the DEX and can be classified into:

- **Speculators**: Users who rely on community tools and insights to make trades based on market trends and predictions.
- **Arbitrageurs**: Participants who seek to profit from price discrepancies across different exchanges, thereby contributing to market efficiency.
- **DApp Users**: Individuals purchasing tokens for use within various applications on the Archethic Public Blockchain and wider DeFi landscape.
- **Smart Contract Integrators**: Developers or projects that implement aeSwap's functionalities within their contracts for purposes such as decentralized exchanges (DEXes), aggregators, or other DeFi services.

## Developers

Developers are the backbone of the aeSwap ecosystem, innovating and creating new applications that integrate with or build upon aeSwap's functionalities. This includes:

- **Interface and Frontend Developers**: Those who create user-friendly interfaces and applications to access aeSwap's services, ranging from basic trading interfaces to complex DeFi platforms.
- **Smart Contract Developers**: Innovators who utilize aeSwap's smart contracts to develop new DeFi products, tools, and services, contributing to the ecosystem's growth and diversification.
- **Wallet and DApp Integrators**: Projects that incorporate aeSwap functionalities into wallets or other decentralized applications, enhancing user experience and utility.

Together, these participants form a symbiotic relationship that drives the growth, innovation, and stability of the aeSwap ecosystem, making it a cornerstone of the Archethic Public Blockchain's DeFi offering.
