# aeSwap DEX Documentation

Welcome to **aeSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) platform powered by the Archethic Public Blockchain**.

aeSwap utilizes an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to facilitate seamless swapping of assets, liquidity provision, and access to yield farming opportunities for users.

Designed with security, low transaction fees, and a high-quality user experience in mind, aeSwap represents a cornerstone of the Archethic Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem.


## What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?
A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central governing body, allowing users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions directly from their wallets. Unlike traditional exchanges, DEXs do not hold user funds, positions, or information, and transactions are facilitated through smart contracts on a blockchain.

DEXs offer a higher degree of privacy and security compared to centralized exchanges, as they do not require users to transfer their assets to the exchange before trading. This mitigates the risk of hacking, fraud, and mismanagement that can occur with centralized platforms.
